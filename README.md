# Underwater-image-color-enhancement-with-PSO-python-implementation

Implemented the research paper, [Natural-based underwater image color enhancement through fusion of swarm-intelligence algorithm](http://umpir.ump.edu.my/id/eprint/26347/) in python language. <br />
### The Four steps strategy followed in NUCE method:
- Superior based underwater color cast neutralization
- Dual-intensity images fusion based on average of mean and median values
- Swarm-intelligence based mean equalization
- Unsharp masking
